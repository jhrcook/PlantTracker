This is a simple iOS application to help my mom track her cacti and succulent collection. 

**Status** (updated Sept. 10, 2019):

I am still working on the detail view for a plant in the Library. Below is an sample of what it looks like.

The current feature I am working on (in the [`edit_plant_info` branch](https://github.com/jhrcook/PlantTracker/tree/edit-plant-info)) will present a segmented controller to the user to change the plant's properties.
